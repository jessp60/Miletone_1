# Stage B.3: search, pins and mentions

Routes covered: search, pins and @mentions. Stages B.1 and B.2 must already pass. Run `check_b1.sh` and `check_b2.sh` before you start and after every change.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_b3.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

## Search and pins (B3.1 to B3.18)

- **B3.1** `GET /api/search?q=` returns `200 {results, next_cursor}` of matching messages, newest first.
- **B3.2** Search only covers channels the caller can access (no private channels they are not in, no
  workspaces they are not in).
- **B3.3** `workspace_id=` limits search to that workspace.
- **B3.4** `POST /api/messages/{id}/pin` returns `200 {pin}` with `message_id, pinned_by, pinned_at`.
- **B3.5** Pinning the same message again returns `200` and does not duplicate it.
- **B3.6** `GET /api/channels/{id}/pins` returns `200 {pins, next_cursor}`, newest pin first, each with
  `message`, `pinned_by`, `pinned_at`.
- **B3.7** `DELETE /api/messages/{id}/pin` returns `200 {"unpinned": true}` and the pin disappears.
- **B3.8** Listing pins of a private channel as a non-member returns `403`.
- **B3.17** `GET /api/search` accepts `limit` and `cursor`; pages are newest-first and follow each other
  with no overlap.
- **B3.18** `GET /api/channels/{id}/pins` accepts `limit` and `cursor`; `limit=1` returns the newest pin,
  the cursor returns the next one, and the last page has `next_cursor` null.

## Mentions (B3.9 to B3.16)

- **B3.9** `@username` of a workspace member resolves to that user's id.
- **B3.10** A user who is not in the workspace is not included.
- **B3.11** Email-shaped (`name@user.com`) and in-word (`hello@user`) text does not match.
- **B3.12** The author mentioning themselves is not included.
- **B3.13** Repeated mentions of one user appear once.
- **B3.14** `@channel` expands to every channel member except the author, without duplicates, also when
  combined with explicit mentions.
- **B3.15** A mention raises the mentioned user's `read_state.mention_count` in
  `GET /api/channels/{id}/read` (the response is `{read_state: {..., mention_count}}`), from 0 to 1.
- **B3.16** A self-mention does not raise the author's own `read_state.mention_count`.
