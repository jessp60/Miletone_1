# Stage B.1: channel management

Routes covered: channel create, topic, name length, listing, members, leave, archive and unarchive. Component A and its checks must already pass (users, workspaces and #general are set up through Component A routes). This is the first B stage.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_b1.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

## Channel management (B1.1 to B1.22)

- **B1.1** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` with `{name}` returns `201` and `{channel}` with
  `id, workspace_id, name, is_private, is_dm, topic, is_archived` (public, not a DM, not archived).
- **B1.2** A new channel's `topic` is `""`.
- **B1.3** `{name, topic}` with a topic of 250 characters or fewer keeps that topic.
- **B1.4** A topic of 251 characters returns `400`.
- **B1.5** An invalid name (`"Bad Name"`) returns `400`.
- **B1.6** A duplicate name in the same workspace returns `409`.
- **B1.7** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}` returns `200 {workspace, channels, read_state}`; every channel
  has the ChannelObj fields and the list includes `general`.
- **B1.8** A private channel is listed for its members but omitted for non-members.
- **B1.9** `PATCH /api/channels/{id}` with `{topic}` by a channel member returns `200` with the new topic.
- **B1.10** The same by the workspace owner who is not in the channel returns `200`.
- **B1.11** A topic of 251 characters returns `400`.
- **B1.12** A non-member who is not the owner gets `403`.
- **B1.13** `GET /api/channels/{id}/members` returns `200 {members}`, each a UserObj
  (`id, username, display_name, timezone, avatar_url, status_text, status_emoji`).
- **B1.14** `POST /api/channels/{id}/leave` returns `200 {channel}`.
- **B1.15** Leaving again returns `200` (idempotent).
- **B1.16** After leaving, the user is no longer in the members list.
- **B1.17** `POST /api/channels/{id}/archive` by the workspace owner returns `200`, `channel.is_archived` true.
- **B1.18** A non-owner archiving gets `403`.
- **B1.19** Archived channels are omitted from `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}` unless `?include_archived=1`.
- **B1.20** `POST /api/channels/{id}/unarchive` by the owner returns `200`, `is_archived` false.
- **B1.21** A channel name longer than 32 characters returns `400`.
- **B1.22** A topic of exactly 250 characters is accepted (`201`).
