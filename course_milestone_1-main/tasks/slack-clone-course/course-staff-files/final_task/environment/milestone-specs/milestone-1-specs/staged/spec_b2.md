# Stage B.2: messages, replies, paging, edit, delete and reactions

Routes covered: posting messages, editing, deleting, reactions, the MessageObj, newest-first paging with cursors, replies, and writes to archived channels. Stage B.1 must already pass. Run `check_b1.sh` before you start and after every change.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_b2.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

## Messages, paging and replies (B2.1 to B2.18)

- **B2.1** `POST /api/channels/{id}/messages` with `{body}` returns `201 {message}` with `id, channel_id,
  author_id, author, body, parent_id, reply_count, created_at, edited_at, files, reactions, mentions`.
  A top-level message has `parent_id` null, `reply_count` 0, `edited_at` null, and empty `files`,
  `reactions`, `mentions`.
- **B2.2** `created_at` is RFC 3339 UTC (`2026-01-02T03:04:05Z`, optional fraction).
- **B2.3** An empty `body` returns `400`.
- **B2.4** `GET /api/channels/{id}/messages` returns `200 {messages, next_cursor}`, newest first;
  `next_cursor` is null when there are no more.
- **B2.5** `?limit=2` returns the 2 newest and a non-null `next_cursor`.
- **B2.6** Passing `cursor=<next_cursor>` returns the next older messages.
- **B2.7** The last page has `next_cursor` null.
- **B2.8** A cursor issued by one node works on the other two nodes.
- **B2.9** A cursor stays valid and returns the same page after new messages are posted.
- **B2.10** A malformed cursor returns `400`.
- **B2.11** `limit` of 0, -1 or 201 returns `400`.
- **B2.12** `limit` defaults to 50 (55 messages and no limit gives 50 and a cursor).
- **B2.13** `offset` and `page` parameters are not supported: each returns `400` or is ignored
  (the same first page as with no parameter).
- **B2.14** `GET /api/messages/{id}/replies` returns `200 {replies, next_cursor}`, oldest first, each with
  that `parent_id`.
- **B2.15** The parent's `reply_count` equals its number of replies.
- **B2.18** `GET /api/messages/{id}/replies` accepts `limit` and `cursor`. `limit=2` returns the 2 oldest
  replies and a `next_cursor`; the cursor returns the rest, with `next_cursor` null.

## Writes to archived channels (B2.16 to B2.17)

- **B2.16** Posting a message to an archived channel returns `423`.
- **B2.17** After unarchiving, posting returns `201`.

## Edit, delete and reactions (B2.19 to B2.29)

Use `PATCH /api/messages/{id}`, `DELETE /api/messages/{id}`, `POST /api/messages/{id}/reactions` and
`DELETE /api/messages/{id}/reactions/{emoji}` (the emoji is URL-encoded in the path).

- **B2.19** `PATCH /api/messages/{id}` with `{"body":"new text"}` by the author returns `200 {message}` with the
  new `body` and a non-null `edited_at`.
- **B2.20** The same request by a user who is not the author returns `403`.
- **B2.21** `DELETE /api/messages/{id}` by the author returns `200 {"deleted":true}`.
- **B2.22** A deleted message no longer shows its original text in `GET /api/channels/{id}/messages`
  (it is left out, or listed as a tombstone with different text).
- **B2.23** `DELETE` on an already deleted message returns `200 {"deleted":true}` again.
- **B2.24** `PATCH` on a deleted message returns `409`.
- **B2.25** The workspace owner can delete another user's message (`200 {"deleted":true}`).
- **B2.26** A member who is neither the author nor the workspace owner gets `403` on `DELETE`.
- **B2.27** `POST /api/messages/{id}/reactions` with `{"emoji":"👍"}` returns `200 {reactions}` that include the
  emoji, even on the first insert.
- **B2.28** Sending the same reaction again returns `200` and the `reactions` value does not change
  (one reaction per user and emoji).
- **B2.29** `DELETE /api/messages/{id}/reactions/{emoji}` returns `200 {reactions}` without the caller's
  reaction.
