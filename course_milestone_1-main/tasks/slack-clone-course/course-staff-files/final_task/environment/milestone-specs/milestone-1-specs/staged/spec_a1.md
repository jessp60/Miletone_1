# Stage A.1: auth, workspaces, channels, open join

Routes covered: auth, workspaces, the basic channel create and join routes, and joining an open workspace. This is the first stage. Nothing earlier has to pass.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_a1.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on authenticated routes. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

Roles are `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest`. The workspace creator is the `owner`. A user who
accepts an invitation becomes a `member`.

In an open workspace, a user who is not yet a member and calls `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` on `#general` or any public channel becomes a `member` (rule A1.28). Later stages use this to add users to a workspace.

## Auth (A1.1 to A1.10)

A1.1. **Register.** `POST /api/auth/register` with `{username, password}`, a valid username and a
   password of 8 or more characters, returns `201` and JSON with `user` and `token`.
   `user.username` is the username sent. `token` is at least 16 characters.

A1.2. **Duplicate username.** Registering the same username again returns `409`.

A1.3. **Invalid username.** A username containing a space returns `400`.

A1.4. **Username characters.** Registering a username with a special character (for example
    `name-x!`) returns `400`. A username is letters, digits and underscore only.

A1.5. **Short password.** A password of 7 characters returns `400`.

A1.6. **Login.** `POST /api/auth/login` with `{username, password}` and the right password returns
   `200` and JSON with `user` and `token`.

A1.7. **Wrong password.** Login with the wrong password returns `401`.

A1.8. **Me.** `GET /api/auth/me` with a valid bearer token returns `200` and JSON with `user`, where
   `user.username` is the username that registered.

A1.9. **Me without a valid token.** `GET /api/auth/me` with no `Authorization` header returns `401`.
   So does a made-up token.

A1.10. **Every node.** A user registered on port `8000` can log in on port `8002`. A token issued on
   port `8000` is accepted by `GET /api/auth/me` on ports `8001` and `8002`.


## Workspaces (A1.11 to A1.22)

A1.11. **Create.** `POST /api/workspaces` with `{slug, name}` and a valid kebab-case slug returns
    `201` and JSON with `workspace` and `general_channel`. `workspace` has `id`, `slug`, `name`,
    `owner_id`, `join_mode`. `workspace.slug` is the slug sent.

A1.12. **Default join mode.** `workspace.join_mode` is `"open"` when the workspace is created.

A1.13. **Owner.** `workspace.owner_id` is the id of the user who created it.

A1.14. **General channel.** `general_channel.name` is `"general"`.

A1.15. **Members list.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` returns `200` and JSON with `members`.
    Each entry has `user_id` and `role`. The creator's entry has role `owner`.

A1.16. **Duplicate slug.** Creating a workspace with a slug that already exists returns `409`.

A1.17. **Invalid slug.** The slug `A` (uppercase, one character) returns `400`. A slug must match
    `^[a-z0-9-]{2,32}$`.

A1.18. **Create without a token.** `POST /api/workspaces` with no `Authorization` header returns `401`.

A1.19. **List as a member.** `GET /api/workspaces` returns `200` and JSON with `workspaces`, which
    includes every workspace the caller belongs to or owns.

A1.20. **List as a non-member.** The same request from a user who is not in a workspace does not
    include it in `workspaces`.

A1.21. **Every node.** A workspace created through port `8000` appears in `GET /api/workspaces` on
    ports `8001` and `8002`.

A1.22. **Unknown workspace.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` for a slug that does not exist
    returns `404`.


## Basic channels (A1.23 to A1.27)

A1.23. **Create a public channel.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` with `{name}` as the owner
    returns `201` and JSON with `channel`. `channel.id` is set.

A1.24. **Create a private channel.** The same route with `{name, is_private: true}` as the owner
    returns `201`, and `channel.is_private` is true.

A1.25. **Join an unknown channel.** `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` for an id that does not exist
    returns `404`.

A1.26. **Join a public channel.** A workspace member calling `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` on a
    public channel gets `200`.

A1.27. **Join a private channel without an invite.** A workspace member who was not invited to a
    private channel gets `403`. This holds in every workspace, open ones too: open join (A1.28) applies to
    public channels only, never to private ones.


## Open join (A1.28 to A1.28)

A1.28. **Open workspace.** When `join_mode` is `"open"`, a user who is not a workspace member calling
    `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` on a public channel gets `200` and becomes a `member` of the
    workspace (visible in the members list).
