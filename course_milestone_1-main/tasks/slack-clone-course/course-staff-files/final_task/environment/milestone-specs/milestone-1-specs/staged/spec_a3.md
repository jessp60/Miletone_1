# Stage A.3: invitations and join mode

Routes covered: invitations (create, list, accept, revoke) and workspace join mode. Stages A.1 and A.2 must already pass. Run `check_a1.sh` and `check_a2.sh` before you start and after every change.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_a3.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on authenticated routes. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

Roles are `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest`. The workspace creator is the `owner`. A user who
accepts an invitation becomes a `member`.

## Invitations (A3.1 to A3.18)

A3.1. **Create.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations` with `{}` as an admin returns `201` and
    JSON with `invitation`, which has a non-empty string `code`.

A3.2. **Member cannot create.** A `member` creating an invitation gets `403`.

A3.3. **List.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations` as the owner returns `200` and JSON with
    `invitations`, which includes the active code.

A3.4. **Member cannot list.** A `member` listing invitations gets `403`.

A3.5. **Accept.** `POST /api/invitations/{code}/accept` with a valid code by a user who is not in the
    workspace returns a `2xx` status. That user then appears in the workspace members list.

A3.6. **Default is one use.** An invitation created with no `max_uses` can be accepted once. A
    second user accepting the same code gets `404`.

A3.7. **Unknown code.** Accepting a code that does not exist returns `404`.

A3.8. **Expired code.** An invitation created with `{"expires_in_seconds": 1}`, accepted after 2
    seconds, returns `404`.

A3.9. **Revoke.** `DELETE /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations/{code}` as an admin returns `200` and
    JSON `{"deleted": true}`.

A3.10. **Revoked code.** Accepting a revoked code returns `404`.

A3.11. **Member cannot revoke.** A `member` calling the revoke route gets `403`.

A3.12. **Targeted invitation, wrong user.** An invitation created with `{"invited_user_id": X}`
    accepted by a different user returns `403`.

A3.13. **Targeted invitation, right user.** The same invitation accepted by user X returns a `2xx`
    status.

A3.14. **Accept without a token.** `POST /api/invitations/{code}/accept` with no `Authorization`
    header returns `401`.

A3.15. **max_uses.** An invitation created with `{"max_uses": 2}` can be accepted by two different
    users (each gets a `2xx`). A third user accepting it gets `404`.

A3.16. **Exhausted is not listed.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations` does not include an
    invitation that has used up its `max_uses`.

A3.17. **Revoked is not listed.** The same list does not include a revoked invitation.

A3.18. **Targeted is single-use.** An invitation created with `{"invited_user_id": X, "max_uses": 5}`
    can be accepted once by user X. Accepting it again returns `404`. A targeted invitation has exactly one
    use, whatever `max_uses` says.


## API conventions (A3.19 to A3.24)

A3.19. **No token.** Every authenticated route returns `401` when the `Authorization` header is missing.
    This includes listing workspaces and members, changing roles, patching a workspace, creating,
    listing and revoking invitations, transferring ownership, creating channels, and joining a channel.

A3.20. **Invalid token.** The same routes return `401` when the token is not a real token.

A3.21. **Unknown ids.** A route that names a workspace slug or a user id that does not exist returns
    `404` (for example, `PATCH /api/workspaces/{unknown}`, an invitation route under an unknown
    workspace, or changing the role of an unknown user id).

A3.22. **Missing fields.** A request that leaves out a required field returns `400`: registering with no
    password, creating a workspace with no `name`, creating a channel with no `name`, and changing a
    role with no `role`.

A3.23. **Malformed JSON.** A body that is not valid JSON (for example `{not json`) returns `400` on the
    register, login, create-workspace and create-channel routes.

A3.24. **Every node.** An invitation created through port `8001` can be accepted through port `8002`, and
    the new member then appears in the members list read through port `8000`.


## Join mode (A3.25 to A3.30)

A3.25. **Set invite_only.** `PATCH /api/workspaces/{slug}` with `{"join_mode": "invite_only"}` as the
    owner returns `200` and JSON with `workspace.join_mode` `"invite_only"`.

A3.26. **Admin renames.** `PATCH /api/workspaces/{slug}` with `{"name": "Renamed Workspace"}` as an
    admin returns `200` and `workspace.name` is the new name.

A3.27. **Member cannot patch.** A `member` calling `PATCH /api/workspaces/{slug}` gets `403`.

A3.28. **Unknown join mode.** `{"join_mode": "closed"}` returns `400`.

A3.29. **Invite-only blocks joins.** When `join_mode` is `"invite_only"`, a non-member calling
    `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` gets `403`.

A3.30. **Invite-only with an invitation.** The same user accepts a valid invitation first, then
    `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` returns `200`.
