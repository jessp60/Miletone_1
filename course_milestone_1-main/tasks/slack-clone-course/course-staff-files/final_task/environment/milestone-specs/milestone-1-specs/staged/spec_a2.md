# Stage A.2: roles, channel permissions, ownership transfer

Routes covered: workspace members and roles, role-based channel permissions, and ownership transfer. Stage A.1 must already pass. Run `check_a1.sh` before you start and after every change.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_a2.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on authenticated routes. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

Roles are `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest`. The workspace creator is the `owner`. A user who
accepts an invitation becomes a `member`.

## Roles (A2.1 to A2.10)

A2.1. **Promote.** The owner sets a member to `admin`. Returns `200` and JSON with
    `member: {user_id, role}`, where `user_id` is the target and `role` is `"admin"`.

A2.2. **Role is stored.** After rule A2.1, `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` shows that user with
    role `admin`.

A2.3. **Demote.** The owner sets an admin to `member`. Returns `200` with `member.role` `"member"`.

A2.4. **Admin sets guest.** An admin sets a member to `guest`. Returns `200` with `member.role`
    `"guest"`.

A2.5. **Admin vs admin.** An admin changing another admin's role returns `403`.

A2.6. **Admin vs owner.** An admin changing the owner's role returns `403`.

A2.7. **Owner via PATCH.** Setting `role` to `"owner"` returns `400`. Use `transfer_ownership`.

A2.8. **Owner's own role.** The owner changing their own role returns `403`.

A2.9. **Plain member.** A `member` changing anyone's role returns `403`.

A2.10. **Unknown role.** A `role` that is not one of the four roles returns `400`.


## Role-based channel permissions (A2.11 to A2.15)

A2.11. **Guest join.** A `guest` calling `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` on a public channel gets `403`.

A2.12. **Guest create.** A `guest` calling `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` gets `403`.

A2.13. **Member creates public.** A `member` creating a public channel gets `201`.

A2.14. **Member creates private.** A `member` creating a channel with `{is_private: true}` gets `403`.

A2.15. **Admin creates private.** An `admin` creating a channel with `{is_private: true}` gets `201`.


## Ownership transfer (A2.16 to A2.20)

A2.16. **Target must be an admin.** Transferring to a plain `member` returns `400`.

A2.17. **Owner only.** A non-owner (an admin) calling it gets `403`.

A2.18. **Transfer.** The owner transferring to an `admin` returns a `2xx` status.

A2.19. **Roles after transfer.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` shows the target as `owner` and
    the previous owner as `admin`.

A2.20. **Old owner.** The previous owner calling transfer again gets `403`.
