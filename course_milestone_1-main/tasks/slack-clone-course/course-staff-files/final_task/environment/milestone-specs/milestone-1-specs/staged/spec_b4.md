# Stage B.4: events, read state and API conventions

Routes covered: WebSocket channel events (including edit, delete and reaction events) (dense per-channel event ids across nodes, resume), read state, and the conventions that apply to every Component B route. Stages B.1 to B.3 must already pass. Run `check_b1.sh`, `check_b2.sh` and `check_b3.sh` before you start and after every change.
Check: `bash /spec/checks/check_b4.sh`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Your service is launched with `/app/start.sh`. The three HTTP nodes listen on
`127.0.0.1:8000`, `:8001`, and `:8002`. All routes are under `/api/...`, return JSON, and take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every request must answer within 3 seconds.

WebSocket: `ws://127.0.0.1:800x/api/ws?token=<bearer>`, one JSON frame per message.
Client frames: `{"type":"subscribe","channel_id":N}` and `{"type":"resume","channel_id":N,"since_event_id":E}`.

## Events (B4.1 to B4.10)

- **B4.1** Subscribe is answered with `subscribed` carrying `channel_id` and an integer `head_event_id`.
- **B4.2** A new message is broadcast as `message.created` with `channel_id` and an integer `event_id`.
- **B4.3** A thread reply is broadcast as `message.reply`.
- **B4.4** Joining a channel is broadcast as `member.joined`.
- **B4.5** Leaving a channel is broadcast as `member.left`.
- **B4.6** Changing the topic is broadcast as `channel.updated`.
- **B4.7** Archive and unarchive are broadcast as `channel.archived` and `channel.unarchived`.
- **B4.8** Event ids in a channel are dense: the first is `head_event_id + 1`, then exactly +1 each.
- **B4.9** Messages posted through nodes 0, 1 and 2 reach subscribers on every node with identical
  consecutive event ids.
- **B4.10** `resume` on another node replays every event after `since_event_id` in order, then sends
  `resumed` with `head_event_id` equal to the last event id.

## Read state (B4.11 to B4.14)

- **B4.11** `GET /api/channels/{id}/read` returns `200 {read_state}` with `channel_id, last_read_event_id,
  unread_count, mention_count`.
- **B4.12** `POST` with `{last_read_event_id}` moves the cursor forward and returns the updated `{read_state}`.
- **B4.13** `POST` with a smaller id returns `200` and the cursor does not move backwards.
- **B4.14** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}` embeds `read_state` for the channel.

## API conventions (B4.15 to B4.20)

- **B4.15** Every authenticated route returns `401` when the `Authorization` header is missing: workspace
  detail, channel create, patch, members, leave, archive, unarchive, messages (post and list), replies,
  search, pins (list, pin, unpin), and read state (get and post).
- **B4.16** The same routes return `401` when the token is not a real token.
- **B4.17** A route that names a channel id, message id or workspace slug that does not exist returns `404`.
- **B4.18** A request that leaves out a required field returns `400`: posting a message with no `body`, and
  creating a channel with no `name`.
- **B4.19** A body that is not valid JSON (for example `{not json`) returns `400` on the post-message and
  create-channel routes.
- **B4.20** A channel created through port `8001` and a message posted to it through port `8002` are both
  visible when read through ports `8000` and `8001`, with the same message id.

## Events for edit, delete and reactions (B4.21 to B4.24)

These use the same dense per-channel event sequence as B4.1 to B4.10. Each one advances the channel's
`event_id` by exactly 1 and is sent to subscribers on every node.

- **B4.21** Editing a message (`PATCH /api/messages/{id}`) is broadcast as `message.updated`.
- **B4.22** Deleting a message is broadcast as `message.deleted`.
- **B4.23** Adding a reaction is broadcast as `reaction.added`.
- **B4.24** Removing a reaction is broadcast as `reaction.removed`.

Not checked, but required: if a `resume` frame has a `since_event_id` older than the earliest event you
still keep, send `{"type":"resume.gap","channel_id":N,"earliest_event_id":E}` before the replay.
